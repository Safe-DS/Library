For this, we use the common example of the Titanic disaster, which is also included in our [`safe-ds-examples` package](https://pypi.org/project/safe-ds-examples). If you want to know more about the dataset, check out its [documentation](https://library-examples.safe-ds.com/en/latest/examples/titanic/). Naturally, you can also use your own data."

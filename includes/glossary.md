# Glossary for important terms in Safe-DS

*[API]:
**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface <br>
An API allows independent applications to communicate with each other and exchange data.

*[Decision Tree]:
A Decision Tree represents the process of conditional evaluation in a tree diagram.

*[One Hot Encoder]:
If a column's entries consist of a non-numerical data type, using a One Hot Encoder will create
a new column for each different entry, filling it with a '1' in the respective places, '0' otherwise.

*[Machine Learning (ML)]:
Machine Learning is a generic term for artificially generating knowledge through experience.
To achieve this, one can choose between a variety of model options.

*[Random Forest]:
Random Forest is an ML model that works by generating decision trees at random.

*[Supervised Learning]:
Supervised Learning is a subcategory of ML. This approach uses algorithms to learn given data.
Those Algorithms might be able to find hidden meaning in data - without being told where to look.

*[Tagged Table]:
In addition to a regular table, a Tagged Table will mark one column as tagged, meaning that
an applied algorithm will train to predict its entries.

*[Regression]:
Regression refers to the estimation of continuous dependent variables.

*[Precision]:
The ability of a classification model to identify only the relevant data points.

*[Recall]:
The ability of a classification model to identify all the relevant data points.

*[Accuracy]:
The fraction of predictions a classification model has correctly identified.

*[F1-Score]:
Combines 'precision' and 'recall' using the harmonic mean.
